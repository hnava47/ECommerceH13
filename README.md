## About The Project
The purpose of this project was to provide an application where users can login and share content with others. The users are able to login either through Facebook or by signing up directly.

Once logged in, the user is able to create posts, like and comment on other posts. The user also has control over their content, so they have the options to edit and delete their posts, comments, and likes.

Once the user clicks the plus button, they are prompted with a modal that allows them to create their content. Once they click the post button, their content will be uploaded and they will receive a success alert in the bottom right corner of the page.
